Installs Waterfox on every Linux machine, as simple as possible!

But can also be used for private use without problems.

# Install this tool
If you wish to install my tool (not needed, it works perfectly without beeing installed), just run: <br>
`$ sudo ./get-waterfox-install` <br>

# How to use it
First thing you have to do is to run the init: <br>
`$ sudo get-waterfox init` <br>
This will create the folders `/usr/share/waterfox` & `/usr/share/waterfox-data`, you only have to execute it once. <br>
<br>
Then you can download Waterfox from the official source: <br>
`$ get-waterfox download` <br>
After that, we are ready to install it: <br>
`$ sudo get-waterfox install` <br>

# Update Waterfox
If you wish to update your installed Waterfox, just run:<br>
`$ sudo get-waterfox update` <br><br>
If you only wish to check if there is an update for waterfox: <br>
`$ sudo get-waterfox checkupdate` <br>

# Cleanup your cache
If you wish to remove the cache copy of the Waterfox tarball in `/usr/share/waterfox-data`, just run:<br>
`$ sudo get-waterfox cleanup` <br>

# Remove Waterfox
If you wish to remove Waterfox, just run:<br>
`$ sudo get-waterfox remove` <br>
This will remove `/usr/share/waterfox` & `/usr/share/waterfox-data` too. If you want to install Waterfox again, you need to reexecute `init` first. <br>

# Remove this tool
If you wish to remove this tool, just run:<br>
`$ sudo ./get-waterfox-remove` <br>
